#Data Centric Cookbook Project
This cookbook app is an app for users to add in cooking recipes as a community site. 
Therefore there is no login, users are expected to be respectful of one another's contribution and not to edit or delete without author's permission.


#UX
The UX design is fairly simple and straightforward to use, the main page displays all the recipes and there are filters at the navbar whereby they can search based on category to whip up something simple or challenging.


#Features
I used simple category search filters as it is relatively straightforward and users can narrow in what they want through the search.
Thereafter they can select the view recipe button to get a full loadout on the recipe.
If its not to their liking the user can return back to search or choose a different search category.
Users can also contribute by adding new recipes in the homepage and they can proceed to edit or delete the recipe in the view receipe page later on if necessary.

#Frameworks Used
The project uses Flask framework and mongoDB database to store and manipulate data. Programming languages include HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python.

#Testing
For this testing, I did manual testing, I first tested the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions also ensuring that the every update and creation is saved and properly reflected on the homepage as well as the search filters.
Next I tested the filter tabs by clicking on every individual filter to ensure that all of them is working as intended. The last filter, the multi-criteria filter due to limitations can only perform the search if all the filters are selected, if one or more is
excluded an error will display. Other than that, all other functions are working normally.

#Deployment
Deployed using Github for repository and Heroku for server hosting, hosting is relatively straightforward and quick to setup and connect.
