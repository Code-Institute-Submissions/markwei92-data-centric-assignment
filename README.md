Cookbook Project App
This cookbook app is an app for users to add in cooking recipes as a community site. 
Therefore there is no login, users are expected to be respectful of one another's contribution and not to edit or delete without author's permission.


UX
The UX design is fairly simple and straightforward to use, the main page displays all the recipes and there are filters at the navbar whereby they can search based on category to whip up something simple or challenging.


Features
I used simple category search filters as it is relatively straightforward and users can narrow in what they want through the search.
Thereafter they can select the view recipe button to get a full loadout on the recipe.
If its not to their liking the user can return back to search or choose a different search category.
Users can also contribute by adding new recipes in the homepage and they can proceed to edit or delete the recipe in the view receipe page later on if necessary.

Flask & mongoDB
The project uses Flask framework and mongoDB database to store and manipulate data.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
